## Objective:
To classify and predict accurately the wart treatment results of 90 patients using immunotherapy in R.

## Process:
1. We have set our working directory.
2. We have imported all the necessary packages required for this task.
3. We have read the source file (details mentioned above) and split it into train and test dataset.
4. Build multiple models using different classification algorithms on train data.
5. Use each model to predict the outcome on test data.
6. Compare the accuracy between the models.

## Algorithms:
1. Logistic Regression
2. Decision Tree
3. Random Forest
4. Naive Bayes
5. KNN
6. XGBOOST

This study is just a basic approach with enough scope of improvement. But this will give you a flavor of the popular classification techniques used today.
